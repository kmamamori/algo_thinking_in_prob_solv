	Problem 3: Rotate Array
		Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
		Example 1:
			Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
			Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
			Explanation:
				rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
				rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
				rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
		Example 2:
			Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
			Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
			Explanation:
				rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
				rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
		Write two solutions to this problem:
			First solution: No constrains, just solve the problem
			Second solution: Solve the problem in-place â€“ O(1) extra space
